# textScatterByChatGPT
## JavaScript for Adobe Illustrator created using ChatGPT for my first time for the New Year's greeting for 2023.
In my network environment, ChatGPT cancels the output with a network error when the code is too long.  
Therefore, I divided the code into as many small methods as possible, asked questions, and manually merged the resulting code.
- It is disposable code that should work for now, so no refactoring or error handling is done.
- Font setting is omitted because it depends on the environment.
- The text scatter has been reduced to 2,000 to avoid heavy processing, but it may take from 15 seconds to 1 minute to process when executed.

Below is the actual postcard design used.  
The artboard was made the size of a postcard, the scattered text was increased to about 20,000, and the font was specified and the layout adjusted.
