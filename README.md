# texScatterByChatGPT
## JavaScript for Adobe Illustrator created using ChatGPT for my first time for the New Year's greeting for 2023.

- It is disposable code that should work for now, so no refactoring or error handling is done.
- Font setting is omitted because it depends on the environment.
- The text scatter has been reduced to 2000 to avoid heavy processing, but it may take from 15 seconds to 1 minute to process when executed.

Below is the actual postcard design used.

The artboard was made the size of a postcard, the scattered text was increased to about 20,000, and the font was specified and the layout adjusted.
